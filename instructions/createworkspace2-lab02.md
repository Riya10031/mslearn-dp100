1. **It is necessary that after completing this exercise , then proceed to the next one**.

1. After signed into azure portal using the credentials given, Search for **Resource Groups** in the search bar or click on **Resource Groups** that you see in the homepage.

1. Then you will find the **dp-100-xxxxxx**, where xxxxxx is the deployment id of the lab. Click on **dp-100-xxxxxx** to find the resources for the lab.

1. Under **compute instances** you can find **notebookxxxxxx**. Click on **Jupyter** to run the notebook to perform the lab. A lot of data science and machine learning experimentation is performed by running code in *notebooks*. Your compute instance includes fully featured Python notebook environments (*Jupyter* and *JuypyterLab*) that you can use for extensive work; but for basic notebook editing, you can use the built-in **Notebooks** page in Azure Machine learning studio.
